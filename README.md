# Bro-Fi Link in Bio

This is a website to direct people to the relevant links in bio inspired by the popular linktree website.
Rather than using a custom domain and pay for a service annually, I have chosen to explore the use of Github's Pages option.
This was an exploration in to understanding html and css as well as responsive web design.

Key Features:
1. Resizable and responsive design for web and mobile 
2. Using only HTML and CSS
3. Explores custom CSS Tags
4. Explores Media queries for responsive screen sizes

The website can be viewed at :
